-> 5) build your first flask apps lesson  
-> lab: make your own routes  

-> alright flask cadet, it's time for your first mission  
-> if you choose to accept, your mission is to define three routes in your flask application  

-> learn by doing  
-> 1. the first route shall be for an "about" page that was shown in the last lesson  
-> this page should provide some content that gives visitors information about you or the website  
-> for this lab, write a blurb about either:  
   -> (a) what you hope to get out of this course, or  
   -> (b) a mini bio of yourself  
-> this route will help you get familiar with returning simple html content from a view function  

-> 2. the second route shall be for a page that lists your favourite songs  
-> this page should showcase a list of songs you enjoy  
-> use some basic html elements to make it look somewhat pretty!  
-> consider using the following tags:  
   -> <ul> (unordered list)  
   -> <li> (list item)  
   -> <strong> (for strong emphasis)  
   -> <em> (for emphasis)  
   -> add some header tags like <h2> and <h3> to introduce sections or make parts of your list stand out  
-> experiment with styling to make the page visually appealing, and make sure to test the route to ensure it displays correctly  

-> 3. the third route shall be for a page that has a link to the two other pages set forth above  
-> this page will serve as a navigation hub, allowing users to easily access both the "about" page and the "favourite songs" page  
-> on this page, create a link to both the `/about` and `/songs` routes using the <a> tag  
-> your link will be in the form:  
   -> <a href="/about">about page</a>  
   -> <a href="/songs">favourite songs page</a>  
-> this route will teach you how to link different pages in your flask app, providing a simple navigation experience for users  

-> if you haven't already, now's a good time to make your first <a> tag  
-> the <a> tag allows users to click on a link and navigate to another page within your flask app  

-> <li> <strong> <em> <h2> <h3>  
-> these html tags will enhance the readability and presentation of your routes' content  

-> once you've defined your routes and tested them, commit your changes using git  
-> make sure your flask application is running and accessible through your local server at `http://localhost:5000/`  

-> git commit  
-> after completing this lab, you will have hands-on experience with defining and linking multiple routes in flask, as well as a better understanding of how to manage navigation between different pages in a web application  

-> previous next lab: dynamic routes in python flask
